## MD5Digest

This is an extremely simple `NSString` category that creates an MD5 digest from a given `NSString`. The logic to do this came straight from [these](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/652300/using-md5-hash-on-a-string-in-cocoa) [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2018550/how-do-i-create-an-md5-hash-of-a-string-in-cocoa) [questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1524604/md5-algorithm-in-objective-c) so you can easily implement it on your own if you would like.

## Installation

Using CocoaPods:

```
pod 'NSString+MD5.h'
```

Otherwise just include `NSString+MD5.{h,m}` in your project.
